### Hi, I'm Julius

I'm an atomic physicist currently working at MIT.

I work in labs where we try to simulate uncontrollable and complicated quantum mechanical systems using controllable and (slightly) less complicated ones.

On the [blog on this website](/blog/) I hope to share some of the interesting things I learn in and outside of the lab, which typically don't find their way into papers.
