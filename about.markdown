I'm an atomic physicist currently at MIT. I work in a lab where we try to simulate uncontrollable and complicated quantum mechanical systems using controllable and (slightly) less complicated ones. In this space I hope to share some of the interesting things I learn in and outside of the lab, which typically don't find their way into journals. 

Every now and then, I also like to generate random things using Javascript.
