I'm an atomic physicist at MIT. I work in labs where we try to simulate uncontrollable and complicated quantum mechanical systems using controllable and (slightly) less complicated ones. In this space I hope to share some of the interesting things I learn in and outside of the lab, which typically don't find their way into papers.
