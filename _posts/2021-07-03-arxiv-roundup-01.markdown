**Quantum Optimal Control of Nuclear Spin Qudecimals in $^{87}$Sr**

**Probing many-body quantum chaos with quantum simulators**  
Joshi *et al.*, [arXiv:2106.15530](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15530)  
A key question surrounding quantum many-body systems is how they do or do not thermalize over time. This notion is intricately related to density of the excited state energy levels of a Hamiltonian (cue [Michael Berry](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspa.1987.0109)). Here, Joshi *et al.* describe a protocol to measure the 'structural form factor' (which is related to this density of states) for a spin system. If implemented this will allow for direct probing of the chaotic and thermalization properties of a large class of systems.

**Quantum gas microscopy of Kardar--Parisi--Zhang superdiffusion**  
Wei *et al.*, [arXiv:2107.00038](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.00038)  
Using the single-site resolution afforded by a quantum gas microscope, Wei *et al.* investigated spin transport in the one-dimensional Heisenberg Hamiltonian. They realize their Hamiltonian by using two different hyperfine states of rubidium, which are prepared on either side of a domain wall in their Mott insulator with a single atom per site. By looking at how this spin distribution relaxes they investigated the scaling of the spin transport (essentially asking: what is the probability $P(t)$ for a spin to end up on the wrong side of the domain wall?). This probability scales with a critical exponent, i.e. $P(t) \propto t^{1/z}$, which they found to equal 1.5 in the 1D Heisenberg system. This is consistent with the so-called Kardar--Parisi--Zhang equation, which describes a number of seemingly unrelated physical phenomena. In the spirit of 'understand your system by making it go kaputt,' they either injected spin impurities in the initial state, or turned on a coupling between chains, which changed the scaling of the transport that ensued.
